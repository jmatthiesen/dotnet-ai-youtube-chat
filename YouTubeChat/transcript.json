natural","Start":423,"Duration":5.36},{"Text":"language to almost execute code because","Start":425.36,"Duration":4.679},{"Text":"that\u0027s what we pass to the model and

that","Start":454.319,"Duration":5.521},{"Text":"so with that prompt I can then use the","Start":457.24,"Duration":5.72},{"Text":"chat client that I initialized earlier","Start":459.84,"Duration":5.72},{"Text":"and simply ask it to complete that","Start":462.96,"Duration":4.72},{"Text":"prompt asynchronously and then it\u0027ll","Start":465.56,"Duration":4.199},{"Text":"come back with a response and I can show","Start":467.68,"Duration":4.28},{"Text":"that so let\u0027s actually jump into some","Start":469.759,"Duration":5.521},{"Text":"code so I\u0027ve added those aspects to my","Start":471.96,"Duration":5.28},{"Text":"application I\u0027m just going to

very","Start":528.72,"Duration":6.92},{"Text":"succinct summary basically the customer","Start":533.2,"Duration":5.44},{"Text":"tried now they\u0027re ready for a return

add AI to that application so","Start":542.16,"Duration":6},{"Text":"now I\u0027m going to take it a step","Start":545.519,"Duration":4.841},{"Text":"further I\u0027m going to use something","Start":548.16,"Duration":5.96},{"Text":"called retrieval augmented generation","Start":550.36,"Duration":5.44},{"Text":"and all that really means is I\u0027m

answer","Start":573.04,"Duration":4.44},{"Text":"questions so this is what it looks like","Start":575.44,"Duration":4.44},{"Text":"in a nutshell you start with some source","Start":577.48,"Duration":5.12},{"Text":"of data in our case we have PDF","Start":579.88,"Duration":5.8},{"Text":"documents one PDF document for every uh","Start":582.6,"Duration":5.44},{"Text":"product basically it\u0027s the manual we","Start":585.68,"Duration":4.68},{"Text":"extract the text from that and then we","Start":588.04,"Duration":4.76},{"Text":"turn it into what I call the Matrix and","Start":590.36,"Duration":4.479},{"Text":"this is the green characters that we","Start":592.8,"Duration":4.479},{"Text":"can\u0027t really read or decipher but it\u0027s","Start":594.839,"Duration":5.081},{"Text":"actually numerical based

how","Start":603.399,"Duration":4.081},{"Text":"to work with so they can do things like","Start":605.2,"Duration":4.4},{"Text":"see what the relationships between text","Start":607.48,"Duration":5.2},{"Text":"are and how text should follow other","Start":609.6,"Duration":6.72},{"Text":"text Etc and so once we have that we

very","Start":618.959,"Duration":6.401},{"Text":"rapidly perform queries against","Start":621.839,"Duration":5.801},{"Text":"vectorized data and then we pass it

just","Start":1451.32,"Duration":3.8},{"Text":"start using them right away however if","Start":1452.76,"Duration":3.96},{"Text":"you would like to extend

a","Start":1479.52,"Duration":4.279},{"Text":"response is um and so you\u0027re going to","Start":1481.559,"Duration":3.801},{"Text":"see that that interface here uh one of","Start":1483.799,"Duration":2.521},{"Text":"the things that I\u0027ll kind of call out","Start":1485.36,"Duration":3.559},{"Text":"here is this chat message so in addition","Start":1486.32,"Duration":4.16},{"Text":"to itself providing these sets of","Start":1488.919,"Duration":3.401},{"Text":"libraries providing uh their

about","Start":1494.36,"Duration":3.84},{"Text":"earlier which is Microsoft extensions. a","Start":1495.919,"Duration":4.201},{"Text":"right so again you\u0027re building on top of","Start":1498.2,"Duration":3.8},{"Text":"a solid","Start":1500.12,"Duration":4.439},{"Text":"foundation now in terms of patterns","Start":1502,"Duration":4.399},{"Text":"right uh one of the things that you may","Start":1504.559,"Duration":4.041},{"Text":"already have your testing framework of","Start":1506.399,"Duration":4.601},{"Text":"choice and so how can you now

test","Start":1514.08,"Duration":2.76},{"Text":"and the two main things that I want to","Start":1515.84,"Duration":2.68},{"Text":"call out here is that the fact up there","Start":1516.84,"Duration":3.6},{"Text":"looks uh fairly familiar and the","Start":1518.52,"Duration":3.72},{"Text":"assertion at the bottom there right","Start":1520.44,"Duration":3.239},{"Text":"should also look familiar the only","Start":1522.24,"Duration":3},{"Text":"difference that I\u0027ll call out here that","Start":1523.679,"Duration":3.36},{"Text":"is that instead of you know having a","Start":1525.24,"Duration":3.799},{"Text":"sort of a a an object objective or a","Start":1527.039,"Duration":4.561},{"Text":"predictable output we\u0027re evaluating the","Start":1529.039,"Duration":4.201},{"Text":"relevance in this case the

good","Start":1535.84,"Duration":3.319},{"Text":"here right so that\u0027s a slight tweak but","Start":1537.64,"Duration":2.8},{"Text":"the patterns are generally the same this","Start":1539.159,"Duration":2.841},{"Text":"looks like a","Start":1540.44,"Duration":3.92},{"Text":"test and then last but not least because","Start":1542,"Duration":3.799},{"Text":"you\u0027re

right","Start":1547.6,"Duration":3},{"Text":"well doesn\u0027t it just make sense that it","Start":1549.24,"Duration":3.4},{"Text":"should also integrate with your tooling","Start":1550.6,"Duration":3.72},{"Text":"and so that\u0027s one of the goals here as","Start":1552.64,"Duration":3.399},{"Text":"well that it should integrate natively","Start":1554.32,"Duration":2.76},{"Text":"into the tooling and so what you\u0027re","Start":1556.039,"Duration":3.24},{"Text":"seeing here is a set of EV valuations on","Start":1557.08,"Duration":3.8},{"Text":"the left hand side in the test Explorer","Start":1559.279,"Duration":3.4},{"Text":"and on the right hand side you\u0027re

of","Start":1564.32,"Duration":5.44},{"Text":"a a pipeline uh inside of Asher devops","Start":1566.76,"Duration":6.399},{"Text":"nice all right so let\u0027s see so how","Start":1569.76,"Duration":6.2},{"Text":"exactly do these AI evaluations work uh","Start":1573.159,"Duration":4.361},{"Text":"generally speaking it starts with a","Start":1575.96,"Duration":2.92},{"Text":"prompt right so you showed us what a","Start":1577.52,"Duration":3.08},{"Text":"prompt was and in this case we\u0027re","Start":1578.88,"Duration":3.64},{"Text":"providing a prompt to a language model","Start":1580.6,"Duration":4.439},{"Text":"to generate an answer all right at that","Start":1582.52,"Duration":4.56},{"Text":"point uh we can also provide a ground","Start":1585.039,"Duration":4.281},{"Text":"truth or what exactly is the

then","Start":1591.679,"Duration":3.961},{"Text":"we provide that to the evaluator so what","Start":1593.84,"Duration":3.079},{"Text":"exactly does the evaluator look like","Start":1595.64,"Duration":3.6},{"Text":"well we saw what the um we saw what the","Start":1596.919,"Duration":4.64},{"Text":"interface generally looks like but what","Start":1599.24,"Duration":4.039},{"Text":"we\u0027re actually providing is we\u0027re also","Start":1601.559,"Duration":3.72},{"Text":"providing it a prompt that provides

whatever","Start":1617.2,"Duration":2.52},{"Text":"that that response it is that you\u0027re EV","Start":1618.52,"Duration":3.399},{"Text":"valuing for right and then last but not","Start":1619.72,"Duration":4},{"Text":"least uh that\u0027s kind of what produces","Start":1621.919,"Duration":4.561},{"Text":"that evaluation result so let me just","Start":1623.72,"Duration":4.839},{"Text":"jump here to a quick demo of what this","Start":1626.48,"Duration":3.48},{"Text":"looks like in action so you\u0027re going to","Start":1628.559,"Duration":4.84},{"Text":"see here I have an xunit test project um","Start":1629.96,"Duration":4.719},{"Text":"again it\u0027s going to look very similar to","Start":1633.399,"Duration":3.041},{"Text":"what you were seeing there and if I were","Start":1634.679,"Duration":4.321},{"Text":"to to what we saw on the slide there if","Start":1636.44,"Duration":4.88},{"Text":"we rightclick run here inside what this","Start":1639,"Duration":3.919},{"Text":"is going to do is it\u0027s going to
